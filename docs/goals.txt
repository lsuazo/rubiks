* Create a nice visualization
	- simple, angled view
	- all sides view
	- top/bottom view
* reach: create a way to have a camera record actual cube, and get state from it
* reach: create interactive way to solve cube - camera sees position, tells you what to do (knows if you are following or not)
* reach: create reinforcement agent that can solve it faster
* reach: can I start from a position, and find faster ways to solve than typical algo
* practice:
	- pytorch
	- cpp - what aspect should be cpp?
		* perhaps cube state, and doing calculations on cube state? like distance from goal? distance from each other? etc
		* yes, have a way to move state to-from python and c++
	- integrated projects
	- profiling
	- maths? group theory?
	- GUI
